# Overview of the Project
This project is based to take you on a Space travel Journey and to explore different plannets and learn about space. This website is fully responsive and made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Challenges
* The first challenge I faced is with styling of the project as doing simple styling with CSS wil be time consuming and code will become really difficult to         understand. To overcome this problem I created a design system for every page using custom properties which made it so much easy to add each properties as Classes.
* Second challenge I faced is with switching between pages which can be achieved in two ways:-
  * First is adding content in different pages and then linking it with anchor tags.
  * Second is adding content in a single page and then using Javascript to switch between pages.
  
  So second method is much better and easy to apply to which I have used in this website.
